## Programs

- Random password generator

## Set Up

If you are are Linux, all the compilers should be available by default.

If you are are Windows, follow [this guide](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-install-c-and-cpp-compiler-on-windows/) to set up the compiler. Additional [link here](https://www.msys2.org/).

I am using VS Code.

Cmd to compile: `cc hello.c`

## Tips

Use `scanf()` for strings without whitespace, otherwise use `fgets()`

Enum is better than `#define`

Use `<ctype.h>` for char checking.
